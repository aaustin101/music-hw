    <p>Round 2: When you're done, you should see the music logo from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Music.gif">here</a>.  However, do NOT use the link above.  There's a copy of the image in the images directory called logo.gif.  Use the relative path to that instead.</p>
    <img src = "../images/logo.gif" alt = "Round 2 Image is broken :(  Fix me by replacing the ___ with the correct relative path."/>
