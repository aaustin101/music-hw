  <h1>Coldplay's page!</h1>
    <p>Bonus Round: When you're done, you should see the picture of Chris Martin, Coldplay's lead singer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin#/media/File:Chris_Martin_2017_in_Hamburg.jpg">here</a>.  However, do NOT use the link above.  There's a copy of the image in the artists directory called chris.gif.  Use the relative path to that instead.</p>
    <img src = "../../images/artists/chris.gif" alt = "Bonus Round Image is broken :(  Fix me by replacing the ___ with the correct relative path."/>
